This program is written in python2.7 which will ask the user whether he/she wants to create a directory, or list the directory or execute a system command. The program should be a menu based program which on execution should look as follows:


Press 1 - For Folder creation
 Press 2 - For listing the directory
Press 3 - For executing a system command

Enter your choice:

If the user enters 1, Ask the user for the folder name and the directory where it will be created also ask if user wants to create the directory in the current directory. The menu should look something as follows:

Enter the name of the directory:

where do you want the directory would be created? press 1 for current directory, press 2 for something else

If the user types 2 then something like this should be displayed:

enter the locai where the directory would be created:

If the user selects 2 in the main menu then you should ask the user which directory the user wants to list, or if the user wants to view the current directory. It should look something like this:

press 1 to view the current directory, press 2 for something else:

If the user types 2 then ask for the location.

Again on the main menu of the user press 3, then something like this should come up where the user enters the system command
